					<h2>Setup a recurring meeting with your client</h2>
					<p>
						Decision makers,
					</p>
					<p>
						in a small room,
					</p>
					<p>
						with you and your teammates.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						If you haven’t already, setup a weekly or twice-a-week meeting schedule with your client. For the sake of brevity I’m treating client as equivalent with stakeholder, decision team, what have you.
						<ul>
							<li>Invite those that can actually make decisions.</li>
							<li>Get the right people in the room each week that need to be there to make a decision.</li>
							<li>Invite your teammates that are actively working on the project.</li>
							<li>Keep the meeting as small as possible.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Set Expectations</h2>
					<h4>Educate #1</h4>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>This is an iterative process.</li>
							<li>The client will see "finished but incomplete work"</li>
							<li>Explain to them where you are in the design process.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Not everyone works this way so explain to them that they will see “finished but incomplete work” (thanks James). They need to understand that they will be involved in the design process and that these meetings are not going to be a “big reveal”. This is an iterative process.
						</p>
						<p>
							Explain where you are in the design process. For example,  “We're looking at wireframes and I want to get your input on the content priorities on the pages we plan to share.” Employ the principle of least surprise here. You don’t want the client expecting a polished presentation if what they are getting is a rough prototype.

					<h2>1 week client review cycle</h2>
					<h4>Iterate #1</h4>
					<p class="fragment">
						<q cite="http://www.designingtogetherbook.com/">“increasing the definition, fidelity, focus, and clarity”</q> of the design and thus of the product.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						I’m going to discuss a 1 week client review cycle however, this can work with a twice-a-week cycle or perhaps even once a day if you really wratchet it up.

						This is an ideal model of how your week might operate. This cadence should work at any part of the process so long as you are ready to produce design artifacts. That can be anything from a flow diagram, site map, or mental model to a full fledged prototype. The point is that you are making progress in “increasing the definition, fidelity, focus, and clarity” of the design and thus of the product. That quote is from Dan Brown's excellent "Designing Together"

				<section>
					<h2>Day 1</h2>
					<p>The day after the meeting with your client</p>
					<h4>Organize #1</h4>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Bookkeeping</h3>
						<p>Send out the meeting notes with the action items.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Share what you presented. Even if you are already changing your prototype or have moved onto the next phase it is important to put the assets into client’s hands.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Prioritize</h3>
						<p>What are you going to work on next? Know your top priority</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Know your top priority but also know your team's top priority. You might be able to crush your thing and then help the team.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is worth vetting the things your client wants you to work on against the things that are actual problems with your site. Figure out which is most pressing.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the client doesn’t have KPIs now would be a good time to define them.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Outline a story</h3>
						<p>Figure out what story you need to tell.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>This may mean combing through user research, doing a competitive analysis, etc. and then figuring out the best design artifact that can tell the story that the data is telling you.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Determine how you are presenting</h3>
						<p>In person, over video, via screencast.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Avoid delivery over email, Basecamp, etc. It is more trouble than it is worth. If you don’t have regular meetings with your clients then get those meetings established. If there is resistance then explain how the project won’t work without their involvement.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the client is eager and you can show them work more often than once a week then by all means do that.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Day 2</h2>
					<p>2 days after your last meeting</p>
					<h4>Iterate #2</h4>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Focus</h3>
						<p>Work on the top priority from yesterday.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Get Feedback</h3>
						<p>Early and often.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Check-in with teammates. Get feedback early and often. Ideally this is impromptu and concise. If you are remote that may mean putting a Google Hangout into the calendar with a teammate. Do it.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, if you can block your whole week ahead of time in calendar then do it. Especially if you are managing multiple clients at the same time this may be the only way to stay sane. You will find at some point that you need to block off time to design.
							</p>
						</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Prepare Alternatives</h2>
					<p>Plan to share more than one version. Even if you only show one.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>This can head off many an argument.</li>
							<li>It allows clients to cherry pick what resonates with them from 2 or more designs. </li>
							<li>It makes it concretely clear that there is more than one way to design a solution to the problem at hand.</li>
							<li>It demonstrates that you are thinking through the problem in different ways and that you are not wed to one solution.</li>
							<li>Preparing several versions is also a way of doing iterations. It is not uncommon to end up with a version assembled from the best parts of your variations, the gestalt, in the end.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide" data-background="#4aa564" data-background-transition="zoom">
					<h2>Pssst! They'll know.</h2>
					<p>
						Don’t make crappy variations just for the sake of creating variations. Yes, it takes time to create variations but, they are paying you to produce work.
					</p>
					<h5>This is the work.</h5>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							How to identify variations: Variations should grow out of the design decisions you are making. If you reach a decision point and it “could go either way” then it might be a place where you explore both sides of the decision creating a variation for each.
						</p>
						<p>Variations should have internal integrity. Like a Choose Your Own Adventure book, if you choose path B then each decision in this variation has to be consistent with path B.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide" data-background="#2e8540" data-background-transition="zoom">
					<h2>Another Approach</h2>
					<p>
						Go with your recommendation. Save versions B and C to answer a question that comes up.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">Or save B and C and go have an ice cream.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							My pal Veronica Erb goes with versions B and C in her back pocket. When the client raises a concern that are answerd by B or C then, and only then, does she show that solution. Or she may even take the feedback, know that B or C have it mostly solved, and nail it next time around.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Choose the right fidelity and then tighten it up</h2>
					<p>The right fidelity is the one that renders your intent the clearest</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Design is rendering intent. If you can make your point with a sketch and everyone in the room gets it then bully to you. Do that. My pal Veronica again: "My stakeholders see sketches." Go with the fidelity that is most helpful. But beware! This only works if your explanation is rock solid.</li>
							<li>If you are presenting wireframes, get the art boards (or equivalent) in order so you can quickly move through them.</li>
							<li>For responsive show wireframes at small, medium, and large breakpoints.</li>
							<li>For interactions of any complexity a simple prototype is going to win out over having to show some wireframes and fumble through how they magically came to life one day.</li>
							<li>This is the top priority you are working on so don’t be afraid at this point to commit to prototyping something if it will help explain your design decisions.</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Take NOTES on design decisions you have made</h2>
					<p>Document your assumptions.</p>
					<p>Take NOTES on what questions you have for the other designers & clients.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							It is okay to share the complexity of what you are grappling with and that you do not have all of the answers yet. Reflecting that complexity back to your client can help them to see it in a new way and perhaps provide guidance. As long as you are making progress towards understanding the complexity you ought to be given the space and trust to admit that the solution isn’t in hand quite yet.
						</p>
						<p>For example, too many states or statuses for a certain object or record in a system. Complex IA in the form of complex global navigation.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Day 3</h2>
					<p>2 days until the next meeting</p>
					<h4>Iterate #3</h4>
					<h3>Productive conflict makes design better</h3>
					<p class="fragment">But, ideally that conflict happens ahead of the client review.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Get your team on the same page. Meet with your team and get feedback. Address their concerns (or write down why you are not going to).
						</p>
						<p>
							If someone has an ax to grind let them get it out ahead of the client meeting. Don’t avoid the conflict letting them stew over something and then decide to unleash on you in the meeting. Don’t ignore them.
						</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Show me, don’t tell me</h2>
					<p>Ask for, or produce, a sketch.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Get clarity around what a teammate is proposing. Make them produce a sketch or reiterate their idea to them with a sketch of your own. If their idea has merit then explore it. If you think it does not write down why not. You should have an answer if and when a client brings up the same issue.

				<section>
					<h2>Set expectations within the team</h2>
					<p>If it is your meeting run it. If not, play a role.</p>
					<p>Properly represent your teammate's work.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>If you are the lead then be prepared to run the meeting. It will not run itself.</li>
							<li>If you can’t agree with your team on a particular piece of design then this might not be the thing you want to present (yet) OR try to accurately represent the disagreement and get the client to weight in.</li>
							<li>If they are presenting their work during a meeting you are leading ask them to go over what they will be presenting and get that into the agenda. Respect the agenda to make sure they are heard. Nothing kills morale like always going last, or not at all.</li>
						</ul>

				<section>
					<h2>Stack the odds in your favor</h2>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Balance the meeting attendees in your favor.</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>For example, I’m weaker at visual design than coding so I try to make sure there is a visual designer on my team and in the meeting either presenting, or speaking to, our visual design decisions. If technical feasibility questions come up I can field those myself so I don’t feel the need to bring along someone from the dev team (though I’m happy if they attend). Tailor the meeting attendees to your needs.</li>
								<li>Get input ahead of time or invite to the meeting subject matter experts who can testify that what you are doing is headed in the right direction or let you know otherwise.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Gain allies</h3>
						<p>Reach out to your team and the wider team.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Call on a teammate to back you up. Have them chime in during the meeting at a set point to bolster your argument.</li>
								<li>Reach out to folks on the wider team (dev, project manager, etc.) and get their opinion. Maybe they know something or have data that will help defuse the situation.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Identify the resistance</h3>
						<p>Meet with individuals one on one.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								If one person in particular is resisting a change you are proposing go meet with them. Better to do it now then when you have an audience. You may be able to resolve the issue one on one or at least get a better understanding of what is driving their reluctance.

					<h2>Prepare to defend contentious decisions</h2>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Go back to user research</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Ideally your research has been summarized in a way that you can easily refer back to principles or recommendations to support your decisions.</p>
							<p>[Talk about USAJOBS research that Excella did. Highlight how we have the Design Pillars and recommendations on our walls. Briefly discuss theming and how that can help set context of the problem you are trying to solve.]</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<p>Be prepared to defend the short and long term implications of your decisions.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							If you can’t show a clear thought process for how you got from problem to solution then perhaps something doesn’t add up in the design. Own up to it and try to address it. If you can’t get it done in time at least be prepared to fess up.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<h3>Know your stuff</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Universal Design Principles: Hick’s Law, Fitts’s Law, etc.</li>

						<h3>Keep messing with it</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Counterintuitive advice but, what else could your design be or do? Leave yourself some time to be creative and to consider alternatives. If this feels like too much pressure, then leave simple tasks for this day. But do it safely (branch your prototype, copy your wireframe/PDF, etc.).
